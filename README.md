## Getting started

To create a poll you first need to come up with a unique namespaced identifier.

```
vberlier.pineapple_pizza
```

Then use the available endpoints to compose your poll however you like:

- `https://poll.fizzy.wtf/show?<poll>=<option>`

  The `show` endpoint is meant to be used as an image. It responds with a horizontal bar that's filled according to the number of votes for the specified option.

  ```
  https://poll.fizzy.wtf/show?vberlier.pineapple_pizza=yes
  ```

- `https://poll.fizzy.wtf/vote?<poll>=<option>`

  The `vote` endpoint is meant to be used with a clickable link to let the user vote for the specified option.

  ```
  https://poll.fizzy.wtf/vote?vberlier.pineapple_pizza=no
  ```

  By default, after clicking the link, the endpoint will bring the user back to the previous page with `history.back()`. However this can cause a slight flicker when voting so you can specify an explicit `redirect` parameter to make the endpoint return a 302 to the url of your choice.
